# React--Pizza-Co
28.08.2023

---

This is the first and the most basic project of a React course that I enrolled.
- It has only one index.js file where all components live. It is a pizza restaurant menu without any interactivity, just a viewing project.
- In this project, reusable components, rendering lists, conditional rendering using ternary operator or short-circuiting, props and destructuing props were practiced.
